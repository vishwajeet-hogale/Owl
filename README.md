# OWL Product Review Application Documentation

## Overview
In a data-oriented world, OWL aims to provide users with a platform to make informed decisions by accumulating crowd-sourced reviews about businesses. The application focuses on individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where users can submit reviews using a 1 to 5 Hoots (stars) rating system. Businesses can also update contact information, hours, and other listing details.
